# Bayesian Machine Learning: A/B Testing
## Motivation
This collection respresents a set codes aiding my learning / recap of in depth Artificial Neural Networks algorithms, from their derivation to applications. This repo contains codes for recaps of traditional neuons, classification tasks, neural network training algorithms such as backpropagation, several practical projects, some basic Tensorflow codes and a larger project looking at Facial Expression Recognition. 

These codes are inspired by a course created by the [Lazy Programmer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer). More information can be found at these two links:

## Installation
In order to install the packaged, the user will require the presence of Python3 and the [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installer. 

For installation on Linux or OSX, use the following commands. This will create an environment and automatically install all the requirements.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Alternativelly, run the setup.sh file as follows:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## Usage
In order to run the solver, type the following commands int the activated python environment. 

```python
python file_name.py
```
